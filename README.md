##Observed Trends
1. Capomulin had the highest survival rate among other drugs and Infubinol drug has the lowest survival rate among the 4 tested drugs.
2. Capomulin drug is the most effective in reducing tumor volume over 45 day period among all other drugs.
3. Ketapril and placebo seems to show increase in metastatis spread and least effective whereas Capumulin drug use seem to show minimum increase in metastatis spread.
